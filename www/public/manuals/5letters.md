# Five Letters

## Guess your opponent's word before they guess yours!

A multiplayer spin-off of a popular word guessing game. Choose a tricky word for your opponent to guess and try to guess theirs in as few guesses as possible.

â¬› Black letter: letter isn't in word
ðŸŸ¨ Yellow letter: letter is in word but at the wrong place
ðŸŸ© Green letter: correct letter at the correct place ðŸ¥³

Each guess must be a real five letter word.

Whoever gets their opponent's word in the fewest tries wins!
