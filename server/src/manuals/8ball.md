# 8 Ball

## Play a game of classic 8 ball pool with a friend!

Goal: pocket the 8 ball after pocketing all other balls of your assigned pattern.

Rules:

- Your assigned pattern is the pattern of the first ball you pocket. If your opponent is the first to pocket a ball you get the opposite pattern.
- Pocketing a ball lets you take another turn
- Pocketing the cue ball is a fowl and results in the other player being able to freely position the cue ball in their next turn
- Pocketing the 8 ball before you pocket all the balls of your assigned pattern results in an automatic loss
