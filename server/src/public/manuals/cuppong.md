# Cup Pong

## Play a game of Cup Pong with a friend!

This game is also known as Beer Pong.

Take turns throwing the ping pong ball into your opponent's cups. If you make your shot, the cup gets taken out.

If all of your cups are knocked out, you get a redemption turn. If you make a shot, a cup comes back into play and you get another chance. If you don't, you lose!
